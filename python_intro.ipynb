    "This notebook will give a \"lightning\" introduction to the Python programming language; we try to focus on the knowledge and skills that will give you the biggest bang-for-your-buck in your projects! That being said, we will cover just a fraction of what Python is capable of. If you want to learn more (or need to learn more) for your projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't hesitate to reach out to us with any questions!\n",
    "* Don't hesitate to reach out to your project mentor(s). If they can't help with a specific question, they definitely can put you in touch with someone who can!\n",
    "* The Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) is super user-friendly and has everything from tutorials to APIs for many modules (if you don't know what this means, hopefully you will by the end of this notebook)\n",
    "* Google is your friend. We google Python questions every 10 minutes when we're writing code. If your question is well-posed, 95% of the time someone has asked it already on the internet. Best websites: https://stackoverflow.com and https://stackexchange.com\n",
    "\n",
    "Just a couple more things before diving in:\n",
    "* We use Python 3 (the newest version of Python). If you are learning Python for the first time, stick to Python 3 (not 2). Specifically, Python 3.6--3.9 will work well.\n",
    "* If you followed the instructions for installing `conda`, you should have Python 3.9 running on your laptop.\n",
    "* Python notebooks *(which is what this document is)* are super helpful as teaching devices. They combine both text and code and allow any user of the notebook to change code and experiment on-the-fly. If you have to submit a report on something you code, consider building a notebook!\n",
    "* Most of the time, Python is *not* built in a notebook; rather, all of the code lives in a `.py` text file. For it to work on your computer (instead of Google's server), you'll need to install Python. You can install it directly (https://www.python.org/downloads/), but we prefer using a *distribution* (for instance, \"conda\": https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which packages Python together with some basic modules. As you'll see, \"modules\" are super useful, and there are hundreds. Conda is really good at managing/installing them, so you don't have to do that yourself. If you need help with that during your project, ask us or your mentor!"

What's more, sometimes one project will use a different version of a package compared to another project, making it difficult to work on both projects using a unified Python environment.

Or you might have a list of people to invite to your birthday party, but rather than making a new variable for each person, you want to refer to the entire list with a single variable name.

Well, the result of \"range\" is an *iterable object* but *not* a list -- all lists are iterable objects, but not all iterable objects are lists!

So putting it together, inside the `for` loop, the *dummy variable* `n` will start at 0 the first time through the code block, then it will be 1 the second time through, ... and the last time through, it will be the length of the list `ages` minus 1. *Here's the key:* remember that Python starts counting indices *from zero*, so `n` will iterate through *all the indices* in the list `ages`!\n",
