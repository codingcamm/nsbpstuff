    "\n",
    "This notebook will give a \"lightning\" introduction to the Python programming language; we try to focus on the knowledge and skills that will give you the biggest bang-for-your-buck in your projects! That being said, we will cover just a fraction of what Python is capable of. If you want to learn more (or need to learn more) for your projects:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Don't hesitate to reach out to us the Simons-NSBP `#help_desk` on slack with any questions!\n",
    "* Don't hesitate to reach out to your project mentor(s). If they can't help with a specific question, they definitely can put you in touch with someone who can!\n",
    "* The Python documentation (https://docs.python.org/3/) is super user-friendly and has everything from tutorials to APIs for many modules (if you don't know what this means, hopefully you will by the end of this notebook)\n",
    "* Google is your friend. We google Python questions every 10 minutes when we're writing a code. If your question is well-posed, 95% of the time someone has asked it already on the internet. Best websites: https://stackoverflow.com and https://stackexchange.com/ \n",
    "\n",
    "Just a couple more things before diving in:\n",
    "* We use Python 3 (the newest version of Python). If you are learning Python for the first time, stick to Python 3 (not 2). Specifically, Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 will work well.\n",
    "* Python notebooks (what this is) are super helpful as teaching devices. They combine both text and code and allow any user of the notebook to change code and experiment on-the-fly. If you have to submit a report on something you code, consider building a notebook!\n",
    "* Most of the time, Python is *not* built in a notebook; rather, all of the code lives in a .py text file. For it to work on your computer (instead of Google's server), you'll need to install Python. You can install it directly (https://www.python.org/downloads/), but we prefer using a *distribution* (for instance, \"conda\": https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), which packages Python together with some basic modules. As you'll see, \"modules\" are super useful, and there are hundreds. Conda is really good at managing/installing them, so you don't have to do that yourself. If you need help with that during your project, ask us or your mentor!\n",

A simple way to debug any part of your code, or break it down to see how data evolves during the execution of your program, is to throw in `print` statements. In a code cell, if you type `print(something)`, Python will include whatever is inside the parentheses in the output.

One reason Python is so widely used is because its syntax -- its set of rules -- is very simple and flexible! Basic snippets of code read very similar to English:"

Well, the result of \"range\" is an *iterable object* but *not* a list -- all lists are iterable objects, but not all iterable objects are lists!

But rather than write the complicated expression on the right-hand-side every time we want to refer to the height of the particle, we usually just write $h(t)$.

In our example, when we called our function to model the falling particle, we passed the values in \"t_final\", 0, and 100 to our function.

    "\n",
    "We've mentioned \"modules\" a few times so far, referring to them as \"Python expansion packs.\" Now it's time we learn what they *really* are. Since you have gotten a taste of how useful functions can be in Python, you'll be excited to learn that modules are \"libraries\" of custom functions that other people have already written, and you get to use them in your code (see the Python [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) for more).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is great, because it allows us to write compact, modular code. We don't ever need to write functions that calculate weighted averages by hand, because someone has already done it for us. All we need to do is *load* their *module*.\n",

    "We will explore what this looks like in the context of [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/index.html) (a.k.a. \"numerical Python\"), which you will probably want to use in 99.9% of all Python code you ever write. Basically, numpy contains thousands of functions built around a new *type* of object, called a \"numpy array.\" Numpy arrays are glorified lists, but they are so much more powerful, as we'll see.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also mentioned \"APIs\" in the context of modules. As promised, we can define an API now. An \"application programming interface\" is just the set of verbal instructions so that you know how to use functions in a module. For example, if we want to use numpy's \"sort\" function, we can just look at the [online API](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.sort.html#numpy.ndarray.sort). The webpage displays the order of the arguments in the function call, what each argument means, what is returned by the function, and some examples on how to use it. Usually, the fastest way to find the API is to Google it: e.g., google \"numpy sort\" and you should be able to find the webpage I linked.\n",

You'll learn something new in fixing a bug, or asking your friend (or us!) for help. But trust me, you can *never* stop learning Python. There is always something else!\n",
