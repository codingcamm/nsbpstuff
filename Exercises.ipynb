    "* Exercise 1: * write a routine that output all even numbers from 4 to 40.\n",

    "* Exercise 3: * create a simple calculator. Tip: write a function that takes in input a string of characters and 2 integeres. If the string is \"sum\", the function must output the sum of the two integers, etc.\n",

    "* Exercise 5: * simulate a turtle race! Tip: define some variables such as turtle1, turtle2, etc, and initialize them to 0. Then write a routine that generates some pseudo-random variables representing the distance covered by a turtle and sum them to the corresponding turtle variable. Finally, output the winner turtle!\n",

    "* Exercise 6: * The rogue language in Sweden. In Sweden, childern often speak a peculiar language named \"rövarspråket\", which means \"the rogue language\". They double each consonant and put a \"o\" in between. For example, \"eat\" becomes \"eatot\". Create a translator, i.e., a function that translates a word or a full sentence from English to \"rövarspråket\". After translating, the function must ask the user if they want to have another word/sentence translated. If so, the function should wait for the user to enter a new input.\n",

    "* Exercise 7: * Playing geometry. Write a function that ask the user of they want to compute the area of: a circle, a rectangle, a square, a triangle. Note that, while you just need one input for circle and square (radius and edge, respectively), you need two input parameters for rectangle and triangle. Can you write a unique function? How? Tip: browse the web for hints. \n",

    "* Exercise 8: * Cryptography ROT-13. ROT13 is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. Write a function that applies ROT-13 to an input string, or that decodes a string written in ROT-13.\n",

For example, if n=3, the function should output on screen 1 3 3 1 ((a+b)^3= 1 a^3+ 3 a^2b + 3 a b^2 + 1 b^3), etc."
